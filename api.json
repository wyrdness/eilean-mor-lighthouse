      "full": "The Eilean Mor Lighthouse mystery is one of the most enduring unsolved disappearances in maritime history. On December 26, 1900, the relief vessel *Hesperus* arrived at the Flannan Isles lighthouse off the coast of Scotland to find all three lighthouse keepers—James Ducat, Thomas Marshall, and Donald MacArthur—had vanished without trace. The lighthouse was in order, the lamp was out, and a meal sat half-eaten on the table. Despite over 120 years of investigation, theorizing, and speculation, no definitive explanation has ever been established for what happened to the three men."
